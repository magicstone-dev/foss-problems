# Free(Libre) Open Source Software Problems

**This repo was created based on recent discussions around the log4j 0day and what it means for maintainers, consumers of FOSS, and for the open source community at large.**

FOSS is not perfect. There are many problems with it, just as with every area of human endeavor.

Before we can solve those problems, we need to determine what they are, seek consensus on their accuracy, and prove the value of solving them. In this process, we may draw the attention of those who can develop solutions.
